       "[\"It's been 75 days of continuous usage of this flagship. If you are confused between which one to buy(Mi 11x Or IQOO 7), let my review helps you well because I tested both the phones.*** After MIUI 12.5 update there is no touch issues ***1. Display - We can buy this phone mainly for its display. Amazing display with amazing touch response. 120Hz refresh rate will make you not to stop browsing the mobile definitely.2. Processor - Legendary processor Snapdragon 870. I used Snapdragon 888 earlier, I can't find any difference between 870 and 888. Both feels same to me for daliy usage and lite games. Definitely go for 870 if you want to same money. It is even better for gaming. You will get the flagship experience.3. Battery- 4520MAH battery stands upto 1day for medium usage such as whole day 4g data on and continous usage of YouTube, whatapp, insta and fb. I regularly charged the device when it is below 25 and it will 45-50 minutes for full charging.4. Camera - Camera is really awesome in good lighting conditions. Low light camera has to be improved. Different types of modes in camera helps for creative photography. Kudos to the different modes.5. Sound - 4 out of 5. Really loud. Dolby atmos is doing it's duty very much loudly.6. Charging - Should definitely speak about charging speed. As of my view, 33W charging is enough. Because it is good to maintain the phones battery in the range of 20-85%. Considering that this phone charges 25 to 90 in 30 mins or even sooner. However you should not use the phone while charging for getting the better charging speed. If we load heavy apps while charging, charging time increases. I got 12.5miui update and noted that the charging speed is improved slightly. So kindly update the system.7. Finally - If you are buying the mobile mainly for gaming then go for IQOO 7. If you are high multimedia consumer and also a part time gamer, then prefer 11x. Cameras quality are similar in both the mobiles and selfie shooters are better in 11x.Looks like Mi 11x always has the bank offer. So go for it, when the budget is tight or if you want to save some money.***After the MIUI 12.5 update, mobile become really awesome.***Cons in Mi 11x:1. Charging speed should be high in this price range.2. Very minute bugs in user interface, which is ignorable.3. Low light camera might be better.I will update my comments if issues faced from now. Hope this will help you😊.\",\n",
       " 'Very bad experience, i am going to return it, i am facing touch issue very much',\n",
       " 'Pros: 120hz, Slim design, sd870, ufs3.1, lpddr5ram, solid tactile, stereo speakers, 360hz touch sampling, oleddisplay, gorilla glass 5 protection, Best macro camera.Cons: green tint on display in darkmode at lowest brightness present in most units,Average cameras',\n",
       " \"I have noticed so many bugs on the first day itself. Worst software experience. Even the update did not solve any of the issues. I will only mention the Cons because you can find the Pros of this device all around the internet because of paid reviews. These paid reviewers never spoke about any of the issues.Note : I DON'T hate Xiaomi or MIUI, infact I am using MIUI since last 5 years and I love it's customisation. I am aware of the bugs that MIUI brings with it and I used to adjust as none of them affected my experience but this time I couldn't bear it because of too many issues.Here is the list of issues -1 - Gestures doesn't work with third party launchers. They wantedly disabled it. And many bugs when you use third party launchers like cannot access ap info. You will be forced to use stock Miui launcher.2 - Camera quality is below average. My 3 year old poco F1 takes better images and videos. By biggest issue is the camera quality. But Macro sensor is amazing. It is almost like a Microscope.3 - Green tint issue is still not fixed and you can notice it everytime an app shows grey colours. Some people say it's not a big issue but believe me once you notice that green tint you cannot ignore it.4 - Display lags and jitters in 60hz refresh rate and it is quite annoying. You will be forced to 120hz all the time which drains battery really fast.5 - Fast charging is not at all fast. My poco F1 charges equally fast with its 18W charging.6 - Recents menu has too many issues when you select horizontal mode.7 - Battery drains very fast even with normal usage.8 - Heats up very easily. It went to 43c while setting up the device and imagine the temperature while gaming.9 - Display has very weird colour tuning. It strains your eyes only in few minutes. I have tried various colour pre - sets but nothing was able to produce pleasing colours. I had severe headache after using the phone for couple of hours on the first day itself . Maybe it is because of absence of DC dimming or anti Flicker.10 - No 4k 60 fps recording for a phone priced at 30k. Even though 870 can do till 8k recording, Sony IMX582( primary sensor) doesn't even support 4k 60 fps recording.11 - What more reasons do you need to understand that buying this phone is a very stupid decision.This device could be so good but Xiaomi messed up in terms of software. If you are expecting Xiaomi to acknowledge these issues and fix them in the future updates, you are mistaken. Just see the history of Xiaomi updates.Maybe this is the reason why Amazon and Xiaomi are providing so many offers and discounts on this phone so that they can attract more customers to buy this garbage.And if you still do not believe me after all this, you can buy the phone and try for yourself.\",\n",
       " \"Great phone with killer performance due to powerful Snapdragon 870 chip. Multitasking, photos + videos and gaming all quite good due to the strong cpu, gpu and image processor of 870.Coming to build quality, it is quite comfortable to hold due to curved design and yet sturdyand weighs less than 200 grams.Coming to MIUI, it takes time getting used to... Coming from One Plus but it has a lot more options and there are no ads / bloatware that people complain about.Scrolling and watching movies is quite good becauss of the smooth 120 hz amoled panel.Camera while being a 48MP sensor is much better than my previous One Plus 7 camera in terms of color accuracy and details.  Possibly due to the better processor 870 vs 855Coming to Cons - it is not built for small hands and will require 2 hand operation.  It does get hot during summers but that's common to all phones with high end processors.Updating this review because got the much awaited MIUI 12.5. A few thoughts on it.1. It feels a lot faster. Gestures especially seem to be very optimized on 12.5 and haptics are much better.2. Battery life seems have to improved by 40-50 mins3. Allows for removing almost all the apps. Making it cleaner experience if one wants it.4. Visuually the icons look much cleaner to the eye.5. Notifications are now getting grouped together making it easier to use.6. Quick access menu looks much cleaner and one can access their smart devices from the mi home app in this menu itself.\",\n",

Must say the real MVP is the display on the phone, this has to be the best display that you can find in this price segment, I have tried a lot of so-called flagships and their screens looked so dull as compared to the Mi 11x. I watch a lot of TV shows and anime on my phone and this has completely changed my experience, hats off to Xiaomi for pulling this one. First impression of using MIUI has been amazing till now, it's crisp, filled with so many functionalities and customizable in almost every aspect.Next would be the camera, I had seen a lot of youtube reviews before buying it and have to say that the device is bang-on, just loving the macro photos. One unique feature is the audio zoom, that combined with video zoom takes videos to the next level.\",\n",

The camera isn't very good. Some users argue that the performance is great enough for the cameras to be not good but that is no excuse for a ₹32000 to have such bad cameras.

       " 'I have switched to this device from POCO F1 which I also bought on 1st day of launch. i.e. completing quarter to three years with that device. Since then my priorities haven\\'t been changed much - flagship performance and value for money. All things come second to that.I missed the most in POCO F1:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0- lack of good, bright display(was an LCD one) \\xa0\\xa0 - Stereo speakers(Poco claim is the pseudo one)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 - and although the phone was one of the fastest of that time, it felt slow to me after a year.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 - the intuitiveness of notification badges (coming from stock android phone)The camera was just according to the 23k price for POCO F1.I have been always a fan of stock android but settled to MIUI because oneplus is no longer the oneplus we knew, and over these years I got used to some features that are not natively supported by stock android without rooting the device, like native call recording, native app lock that cannot be uninstalled, native dual app support for all the apps. And now somehow these features became a necessity for me. Still, if Oneplus would offer the same value as MI, surely I would have opted for Oneplus but that will not be going to be the case in future too.So priorities for buying were AMOLED display with 90/120Hz refresh rate, stereo speakers, flagship-level processorSo talking first of\\xa0--------------------------Design/ Hardware ---------------------------I do not care much about the back of the phone, as long as I use a back cover, SO any colour is fine, don\\'t care much about the rest, camera bumps are everywhere so no complaints.-I want narrow bezels: present.-I prefer capacitive fingerprint over optical one: present-I prefer metal/plastic back to a glass one: not present-I want headphone jack BADLY: NOT present-I prefer IR face scan over camera-based: not presentHole punch is generic, and doesn\\'t cover more than needed space.It has Wifi6 which is appreciable.It uses Corning\\'s Gorilla Glass 5 which is one generation older, but it\\'s okay.It has touch sampling tech, but I am not an FPS gamer.I don\\'t know why Mi doesn\\'t give NFC in Indian phones, as if adding it would be costly, Hey MI we Indians want NFC, okay?------------Display -------------Sure I feel upgraded after switching from an LCD. clearly, I can see the deeper black on that super bright 900nits max brightness display. Apart from it being tall from the wider POCO F1, it is also 0.5\" larger at 6.67\". Its aspect ratio is at the taller side i.e. 20:9. while most content is shot in 16:9 which is a little bit taller(landscape). Making such a big phone wider would have made it not easy to handle it but I would have managed it because for me the big screen is of no use If my media(mostly youtube and movies) are in the same area as in a phone of shorter screen size.Again movies in cinematic resolution work well for this screen, Screen is a pro for the latter and a con for the former, I am a balance out of both screens seeking consumer.The second thing is the 120Hz refresh rate, most people would not bother about it. But once I switched to it and whenever I used POCO again at 60Hz I clearly felt that downgrade although it is not a biggie but once you stick to it, you may not want to go to 60Hz again. As of now, Mi 11x doesn\\'t support variable refresh rates so the battery may discharge a bit faster, because there are some apps where 120Hz is not supported or needed, variable refresh rate could be handy in those cases, however, it may come via OTA update in future.Lastly, sunlight brightness is too good, peeking at 1300nits.The display is for sure a flagship one.------------------Performance -------------------It\\xa0has snapdragon 870. The only thing that lured me initially. performance is excellent, top-notch.-----------Camera-\\xa0-----------After being in the work domain my camera uses has reduced a lot, I capture very few photos these days. So the camera wasn\\'t my priority, And even if the camera was my priority I would not have got near-flagship camera performance in that budget.Rear Cameras\\xa0Image quality is below average at best. Many times I felt a downgrade in details while comparing images captured from POCO. Instead of macro, I would have liked a telephoto lens. Images on zooming(in gallery) clearly shows how pathetic level has been achieved. Lens level 2x zoom is bearable.The front camera is also average.Behind ditching Mi 11x Pro there was a reason because 1. It doesn\\'t offer the real upgrade over the 11x in camera performance, increasing megapixel would not be considered an upgrade if image quality is not improved. 2. neither 11x or 11x pro offer OIS.I also don\\'t care about 4K recording because it uses a big chunk of space, for me 60fps1080p is fine.--------------Software ---------------I hate any other UI that is not near stock till date, so the first app I install on my new phone is Nova launcher(prime) and I am good to go. Half the trouble goes after that. For the rest of the troubles, I have to make myself accustomed like I can\\'t change how notifications appear in MiUI. At least I want to change the response button of notifications to be bigger like in stock android.The second thing is notification badges don\\'t give the same feel as in stock android.Non-uninstallable bloatware is also an issue, but I have managed to ignore this by hiding bloatware from app-drawer, disabling notification from all non-removable unwanted apps etc.As of now current MiUI on it is super buggy. Like gestures don\\'t work on the nova launcher, music playback notification doesn\\'t go away etc. The system-wide dark mode also blacks some major information on some apps, so it\\'s not perfect.Widevine L1 certification is present, also supports HDR10.what I really like about the 11x software is1. grains and fade in reading/night/blue-light filter-mode, such a good retro feel is achieved by this unique software feature.2. Always-on display is there, but unlike moto phone, it is not interactive3. Haptic feedback is decentBeing in a work environment I sometimes have to record calls,\\xa0It was easy on POCO, now in Mi 11x phone and message apps are replaced by google\\'s phone and message apps. I am a fan of both but auto call recording now started by a computer disclaimer which the other person will also hear \"this call is being recorded\"; bruh, disabled.One issue which is prominent is the location of the proximity sensor, it is not placed right and many, many time you will be muting, holding, putting on speaker your call inadvertently.I like to keep my app-lock and lock screen pattern different so native app lock is welcomed.----------Sound-----------It has stereo speakers, which are true stereo, loud and clear. I am happy with the loudness of the speakers as long as they won\\'t get crackled in future.Hi-res certified and headphone output is decent, loud, typical non-DAC output. Although it supports Dolby Atmos for smartphones.Earpiece speaker output is quite good, loud, clear, just it that you have to habituate yourself to keep your ear at a particular point of the phone for that.-----------Battery------------The battery is decent enough to last a day, with no sudden drops in battery level. Overnight juice theft is low. No problems in battery dept.Comes with support of 33W charging max, which is fine but considering competition 50W could have been better.It charges to full in nearly one hour generally.--------Pros-\\xa0---------Performance; gap in performance to snapdragon 888 is slim and would be fine for most.-Great AMOLED display, brightness is nitty.- Super stereo speakers, sufficiently loud-Good battery life, 33W charging-Personally liked MiUI\\'s Night mode grains and fade feature-Physical fingerprint reader-good sound output- Excellent Value for money\\xa0---------Cons----------- Below average camera. Boo! Have it been at least above average, this star phone could have been a superstar- Auto call recording is ruined (3rd party is never as good as a native feature, also paid)- Software is buggy as of now- No headphone jack- Indian version doesn\\'t have NFC (why Mi?)Well, Mi11x is for sure a value for money device, ensure near-flagship performance has flagship-level display and sound.Given its below-average camera, it is most suited for working professionals, gamers on budget and all pro-performance people(like me).\\xa0Overall ★★★1/2⯨☆Thank You!',\n",

Stereo Speakers are just awesome and it also gives great audio output too on my BoAt Airdopes 461.• OS: Not a huge fan of MIUI because of ads but xiaomi made some changes this time and you can disable ads and there are only 6-7 miui apps that you can\\'t uninstall or disable but those doesn\\'t bother me because of everything else is great about this phone and you can install any launcher you like, i personally use Nova Launcher in almost every phone i use. However you cannot use navigation gestures in third party launchers and i thought that xiaomi did this intentionally to force customers to use MIUI but then i found out that this is a bug with Android 11, and google will fix this because same thing happened when Android 10 was released.',\n",

No matter even if you are using it or not, you'll have to charge by end of the day. This device is much better... lasting for two days with regular usage.2. Camera: I feel camera quality is excellent for this price range. Competitive with S7.3. Performance: Obviously better than S7. I feel like I got freedom from the old mobile. No lag, no hang using multiple applications.(I have gone through performance differences between snapdragon 870 and 880 in YT and preferred to buy this device) I feel there is much difference in speed and processing while playing games compared to S7.4. Display: Obviously better. But S7 had blue ray filter. So, I am little disappointed since 11x don't have it.5. Design: Look wise good, gorilla glass 5, not waterproof but scratch and water resistant. S7 is waterproof.Overall(after 15 days of usage): I feel like I made a good decision buying this device.\",\n",

I haven't seen a better display on any phone yet. 120 Hz refresh rate with 360 Hz touch sampling rate is a dream come true for any gamer like me.Secondly, the Snapdragon 870 processor make the phone usage experience extremely smooth and delightful.Coming to camera, the phone doesn't disappoint at all. With so many cool shooting modes like clone mode and the time freeze mode with AI skyscaping, I can now proudly flaunt my photography skills with ease.The phone fits perfectly in your hand and is super light and slim even after having so many flagship hardware and specs. The frosted glass back make the phone look extremely gorgeous.The MIUI on this phone is the claenest I have seen. No bloatware on the UI accentuates the experience even more.Camera zoom coupled with audio Zoom seemed to be a little too much to ask for but when I really tried this on my phone, I was pleasantly surprised and this cool feature could prove to be of fantastic use in adverse shooting conditions.Overall a 10 on 10 to the phone and Xiaomi has really proved that when it comes to technology, they are the best in the industry.\",\n",

SNAP DRAGON 870 processor It works very smooth. U can play PUBG without any lags. I am game lover i actually brought this for pubg 😉. I am  5 star satisfied with this work2. Mine is 8 gb ram. U can open as many apps as u wish like 30 + app it still opens the first app in faction of seconds. 5 star for ram3. 3d speakers. It first didnt give me dolby but after update it got dolby atmos. U can play pubg without hearphones cause u can hear seperatly the left and right speakers sounds when enemy in pubg move around. 3 dimensional sound i can say 4 star to speakers4 Charging was very quick it gets chargee with 33 w charger. It charges to 100 % in less than hour 4 satr to charge5 camera better finger print side scanner is ver quick 4 star There are still good features i have to explore them CONS1. HEATING WHILE CHARGING or when hot spot is on around camera(no heating while u playing intense pubg game)2 battery drains moderate way. If  u play pubg for 30 mts it gets drained from100% to 65% around but quick charge can take care of this not issue3 no 3.5 mm jackbut they provide u connect cable4.

       " 'I purchased this phone for its processor Snapdragon 870 (because who has phones which this processor in less than 30k segment.. awesome right?). But to be honest the best part now seems the display. It is so bright, colours are so vivid and gorgeous. You have to see it to believe it. Only after the purchase I read about its DisplayMate A+ certification and figured out that the display is one of the key features. Lucky Me :D.Cameras in all Xiaomi devices are good but what I loved in Mi11X is Time freeze motion mode. Device is super thin and very light and haven’t faced any heating issues which is very difficult to achieve for a heavy battery phone. Purchased the celestial silver and what a gorgeous colour. Definitely the go to colour if you are looking to change your usual black phone. Also, I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. Great job Xiaomi on the device!',\n",

NOT a single issue till now (except two i will talk about it in cons section)Speakers:- they are very loud even louder than the oneplus 7 pro and have good base too. Haptics:-they are good but on the first day it was making a sparkling sound but that got fixed by their own.Selfie camera:- it performs very good in daylight and when their is enough light but it sucks in low light. I would prefer to use the gcam.Macro camera:- it isn't like the 2mp camera which brands give just for numbers. It's a true macro camera, it can go very close and gives a clear photosCamera options:- they have given a lot of options in the camera app. Video recording option is available in every camera lens on this phone.Gcam photos- I didn't like the stock camera but the images on the gcam are really different, they have better dynamic range , better resolution and so on...low light photos are also better in gcam CONS:-Low light photography:- the camera doesn't performs well in low light, ut performs like a 15k deviceMiui:- this is the main thing which is holding it back to become the true flagship killer. It isn't optimised completely, i found bugs on the second of usage only...Gaming:- though it can handle pubg in smooth+extreme very easily but if you are buying it for competitive then it will not met your expectationsBut Yeah Xiaomi can fix theses issue by improving their ui.Overall camera:- they are not as good as other 30k phone(it doesn't have 4k 60 and ois too) but in daylight or in some condition it performs very very goodFingerprint reader:- it has the side mounted fingerprint sensor I don't like it, i was expecting an in display fingerprint sensor, it looks vey premium! as compared to side mountedSo the verdict is that if you need a decent camera, great performance for casual gaming and a very great quality display then you can go for itMany people are going for iqoo 7,It's a very good device but still I won't prefer you to buy (it's my personal opinion don't take it seriously)I will upload some sample shots later soonThanks!And wear a mask✌️🤘\",\n",
